# SmartWatch Realistic Health Data Implementation

## Overview

Updated the SmartWatch component to generate realistic health data with proper update intervals and natural variations, as requested by the user.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Realistic Data Generation

- **Heart Rate**: 60-100 BPM with natural variation (±3 BPM)

  - Higher during day hours (6 AM - 10 PM): +10% multiplier
  - Lower during night hours: -10% multiplier
  - Base range: 72-88 BPM for normal resting rate

- **Blood Pressure**: Stable realistic values

  - Systolic: 118-132 mmHg (normal range)
  - Diastolic: 76-84 mmHg (normal range)
  - Small variation: ±2 mmHg per update

- **Blood Oxygen Level**: Very stable (96-100%)

  - Base: 97-100% (normal healthy range)
  - Minimal variation: ±1% to maintain realism

- **Stress Level**: Realistic daily pattern (1-5 scale instead of high fake values)

  - Base: 2-5 (low to moderate stress)
  - Night time: 50% lower stress levels
  - Variation: ±1 level per update
  - Range limited to 1-10 with most values being reasonable

- **Body Temperature**: Very stable core temperature
  - Range: 98.1-99.3°F (normal body temperature)
  - Minimal variation: ±0.2°F per update

### 2. Realistic Update Intervals

#### Every 5 Seconds (Most Metrics):

- Heart Rate
- Blood Pressure
- Blood Oxygen Level
- Stress Level
- Body Temperature

#### Every Minute (Step Counter):

- Steps Today: Realistic increments based on time of day
  - Active hours (7 AM - 10 PM): 5-30 steps per minute
  - Inactive hours (10 PM - 7 AM): 0-5 steps per minute
  - Starting base: 2000-5000 steps randomly generated

#### Calories Burned (Updated with Steps):

- **No longer changes every 5 seconds** ✅
- Base metabolic rate: ~1.3 calories per minute
- Activity multiplier based on step increases
- More realistic calorie burn calculation
- Starting base: 150-350 calories randomly generated

### 3. Time-Based Behavior

#### Active Hours (7 AM - 10 PM):

- Higher heart rate (+10%)
- More steps per minute (5-30 steps)
- Normal stress levels

#### Inactive Hours (10 PM - 7 AM):

- Lower heart rate (-10%)
- Fewer steps per minute (0-5 steps)
- Reduced stress levels (50% lower)

### 4. UI Improvements

#### Connection Options:

- **WebSocket**: Original connection method
- **HTTP Polling**: Fallback connection method
- **Demo Mode**: New realistic mock data generation

#### Fallback Behavior:

- When WebSocket and HTTP polling fail, automatically starts realistic demo data
- Shows "Using simulated data for demonstration" message
- Retries real connections every 30 seconds while showing demo data

#### Data Display:

- All metrics show realistic ranges and proper health status indicators
- Color coding: Green (normal), Yellow (moderate), Red (concerning)
- Shows "--" only when completely disconnected, not during demo mode

### 5. Health Status Ranges

```typescript
Heart Rate:
- < 60 BPM: Low (Blue)
- 60-100 BPM: Normal (Green)
- > 100 BPM: High (Red)

Blood Oxygen:
- < 95%: Low (Red)
- ≥ 95%: Normal (Green)

Stress Level:
- 1-4: Low (Green)
- 5-7: Medium (Yellow)
- 8-10: High (Red)

Body Temperature:
- < 97°F or > 99.5°F: Abnormal (Red)
- 97-99.5°F: Normal (Green)
```

### 6. Code Architecture

#### Mock Data Generation:

- `generateRealisticHealthData()`: Creates natural variations in health metrics
- `updateStepsRealistic()`: Handles step counting with time-based logic
- `updateCaloriesRealistic()`: Calculates calories based on activity and metabolism
- `startMockDataGeneration()`: Initializes realistic demo mode
- `stopMockDataGeneration()`: Cleans up intervals when switching connections

#### Update Intervals:

- Main health metrics: 5-second interval
- Steps and calories: 1-minute interval
- Connection retry: 30-second interval

## Usage

### Manual Demo Mode:

1. Click "Demo Mode" button to start realistic simulation
2. Watch natural variations in health data
3. Observe different patterns during day/night simulation
4. Click "Disconnect" to stop simulation

### Automatic Fallback:

1. Component tries WebSocket connection first
2. Falls back to HTTP polling if WebSocket fails
3. Automatically starts realistic demo data if both fail
4. Continues retrying real connections in background

## Benefits

✅ **Realistic Data**: No more obviously fake values  
✅ **Proper Intervals**: Calories don't change every 5 seconds  
✅ **Natural Patterns**: Data follows daily rhythm patterns  
✅ **Appropriate Ranges**: All metrics within healthy human ranges  
✅ **Smart Fallback**: Always shows meaningful data for demonstration  
✅ **User Control**: Manual demo mode for presentations

This implementation provides a much more believable and professional demonstration of health monitoring capabilities while maintaining the technical architecture for real smartwatch integration.
